Thank you for installing AutoSubFixer!

To use AutoSubFixer, do the following:
    1. Right-click on the text file you want to fix.
    2. Hover on "Send To".
    3. select "AutoSubFixer (Overwrite)".
    4. Done! the file is now fixed and ready to use.

Use "AutoSubFixer (Overwrite)" to overwrite the original file. Otherwise, selecting "AutoSubFixer" will create a new file (suffix "-encoded").
